# My First Blog Post

Hello! I'm writing my first post on this blog built with Next.js and Contentlayer.

## Features of This Blog

This blog is built with the following tech stack:

- **Next.js 14**: Latest React framework
- **Contentlayer**: Easy MDX file management
- **TailwindCSS**: Fast styling
- **TypeScript**: Type safety

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component example:

```jsx
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

## Conclusion

I'll continue to share various development experiences and knowledge!

Thank you. üôè
